===================
Parking Violations
===================
- Different ways to encode null values. For example, null values in 
vehicle_make are represented by a missing value (empty string) while missing
values in vehicle_year are represented by a 0. 
Other case happens with the meter_number, which can be a valid string,
a '-' or a missing value (empty string). No clear difference to what is the
difference between missing and '-'. 

- violation_description column contains, in some cases the violation_code. For example:
an entry in violation_description '14-No Standing' has the violation_code (14)
in it.


===================
Between Datasets
===================
- In open violations the plate is identified as 'plate' while in 
parking violations is identified as 'plate_number'.

- Violation description in open violations is encoded differently than in 
parking violations. Furthermoire in the first one the column is called 'violation'
while in the second one 'violation_description'
